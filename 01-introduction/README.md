## Introduction

* Reference: [Introduction - w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
* JavaScript can change:
  * HTML content.
  * HTML attribute values.
  * HTML styles (CSS).
  * Hide/show HTML elements.

## Where To

* Reference: [Where To - w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp)
* In HTML, JS code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.
* > Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: `<script type="text/javascript">`.
The type attribute is not required. JS is the default scripting language in HTML.
* JS in `<head>` or `<body>`.
* > Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows
down the display.
* Scripts can also be placed in external files.
  * > External scripts cannot contain `<script>` tags.
  * Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
    * It separates HTML and code.
    * It makes HTML and JS easier to read and maintain.
    * > Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.
